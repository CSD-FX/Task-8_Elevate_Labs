# Jenkins Maven Java CI/CD Pipeline

A simple Java "Hello World" application automated with Jenkins and Maven, demonstrating fundamental CI/CD concepts on an EC2 Ubuntu instance.

## üìã Project Overview

This project sets up a complete CI/CD pipeline where:
- A basic Java application is automatically built using Maven
- Jenkins orchestrates the build process  
- Everything runs on an AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance
- Successful builds produce executable JAR files

## üõ†Ô∏è What We Accomplished

1. **Set up the infrastructure** - Configured an EC2 Ubuntu instance with Java, Maven, and Jenkins
2. **Created the application** - Built a simple "Hello World" Java app with proper Maven structure
3. **Configured Jenkins** - Set up a freestyle job that automatically:
   - Copies the source code from the filesystem
   - Runs Maven build commands (`clean package`)
   - Compiles the Java code and packages it into a JAR file
   - Executes the application to verify it works
4. **Established automation** - Every time we trigger the build, Jenkins automatically compiles, tests, and packages our application
5. **Verified success** - Confirmed the pipeline works by seeing "Hello, Jenkins + Maven!" output and BUILD SUCCESS status

## üöÄ The Outcome

We now have a working CI/CD pipeline that can automatically build our Java application with a single click, demonstrating the fundamental concept of continuous integration where code changes can be automatically tested and packaged.
